# retrieve primary sequences eligible for deorphanization directly from database
# for deorphanization:
# filter on primary sequences related to protoclusters, not compounds
# filter on organism (at least type and genus)
# filter on length (somewhat, the iteratives are not interesting anyway -- prioritize longer and exact matches)
# write out scored results with top 50 matches to file (include alignment)
